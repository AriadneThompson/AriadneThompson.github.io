<h2>Fifty Princesses</h2>

<p>A fun little experimental piece, written to get me back into the swing of writing after a long hiatus. It's not exactly well written or edited, but hopefully it is at least enjoyable.</p>

<h2>The Human Nature</h2>

<p>I don't usually write poetry or overtly political pieces, but this one was an exception. It was written for the anthology <i><a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/vanessa-atalanta-and-aspen-perry-and-tony-warner-and-amanda-coleman/lost-ground/ebook/product-72v5gv.html">Lost Ground</a></i>, published under the pen name Vanessa Atalanta.</p>

<h2>A Mountain, Inverted</h2>

<p>I had noticed that I was writing a lot of introspective stories in which nothing really "happens", so I decided to challenge myself to write something with a bit more action. This one hasn't been published anywhere (yet).

<h2>Wretched Creatures</h2>

<p>I always found the idea of doppelg√§ngers fun, so I decided to write a story involving one. This story was published in <i>Concrete</i>, the University of East Anglia's student newspaper.
