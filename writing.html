	<h2>A Mountain, Inverted</h2>

	<p>I had noticed that I was writing a lot of introspective stories in which nothing really "happens", so I decided to challenge myself to write something with a bit more action. This one hasn't been published anywhere (yet).

	<h2>Wretched Creatures</h2>

	<p>I always found the idea of doppelg√§ngers fun, so I decided to write a story involving one. This story was published in <i>Concrete</i>, the University of East Anglia's student newspaper.

	<h2>Practical Applications of Fluid Dynamics</h2>

	<p>One of the first pieces I wrote that I was genuinely happy with. This piece was selected as Editor's Choice for issue #4 of <i>Octarine</i> and published under the pseudonym Vanessa Atalanta, alongside illustrations by Amber Donovan-Stevens.</p>
