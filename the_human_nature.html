	<h1>The Human Nature</h1>
	
	<div>
	
	<p>A crow pecks the eyes out</p>
	
	<p>of a sheep whose head is caught in a wire mesh fence.</p>
	
	<p>A fox bites into a housecat's tender nape,</p>
	
	<p>breaking its neck.</p>
	
	<p>A spider injects paralytic venom into a moth</p>
	
	<p>before encasing it in webbing and eating it alive.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>When did we become so cruel?</p>
	
	<p>At least spiders don't force their prey</p>
	
	<p>to break down crying on the food bank floor.</p>
	
	<p>At least crows look their victims in the eye.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>Is this the Human Nature?</p>
	
	<p>What sick, toxic gene pool did it crawl out of?</p>
	
	<p>If—Heaven forbid—the Human were manufactured</p>
	
	<p>it would have to be outlawed and annihilated at once</p>
	
	<p>as a crime against nature.</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p>And what a heartless joke</p>
	
	<p>that the doe, the rabbit, the trembling field mouse</p>
	
	<p>must walk down the high street,</p>
	
	<p>go within striking distance of the Human,</p>
	
	<p>and ask it for A Young Person's Day Ticket, Please.</p>
